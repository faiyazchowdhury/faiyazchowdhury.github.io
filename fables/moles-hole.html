            <div class="fable-text">
                <p>There was once a family of Moles that were looking for a home. They found a big cave and they were lived there. One of the Moles said there was a deep hole that was too dangerous, but the rest of the Moles said not to worry about it.</p>

                <p>One day, two of the young moles fell into the Hole while playing. The family were calling into the Hole, but heard nothing. "The Hole was bottomless." they said. Sad, the Moles wept, but said this was still safer than outside the cave. One of the Moles kept looking into the Hole. The other Moles told him not to.</p>

                <p>They were safe, but sometimes, few young moles fell into the Hole. After a long time, the Mole looking into the Hole saw a sparkle in the bottom. "Look!" he yelled! "The Hole is not bottomless!" Some of the moles, seeing that the Hole were not bottomless, went outside of the cave and brought leaves and branches. They claimed to the bottom of the deep Hole and put the branches and leaves on the ground to soften the bottom of the Hole, so that if anyone fell there, they would fall on the leaves and be safe.</p>

                <p>This was taking a long time, and some of the moles were scared their children would fall in before the hole was done, and dug out dirt and threw dirt and water from wells into the Hole to fill it up. This took much less time, but this buried and drowned the moles that were already at the bottom putting leaves and branches. When the holes was full. The remaining moles felt safe.</p>

                <p>The next day, one of the young moles fell into Hole. How? Cried the mother, we filled that Hole. But then they looked and saw that from the dirt and water they took out from the ground and the well to fill the big hole, they made many other deep holes and their babies could fall into them.</p>
