                <p>The Horse enjoyed being in the Sun. It loved the light and the warmth that the Sun gave, and that the trees and grass gave more air when the Sun was out. When the Sun set, the Horse became sad. The Horse doesn't sleep much so its nights were long, dark and cold. It could not see or do much.</p>

                <p>One day, the Horse began to chase the Sun so that day never ends. With the everlasting sunlight, the Horse could play, breathe the freshest air, and always feel the Sun's warmth and see its light.</p>

                <p>However, over time the Horse noticed that there were somethings that it did not like. The Horse found it difficult to nap during the day. It noticed that it had little time for itself because all other animals were awake during the day. The day was noisy and congested. Overtime, the Horse got annoyed and started hating the Sun.</p>

                <p>Then the Horse stopped chasing the Sun, and then began chasing the Moon. The night was quiet. The Horse immersed itself in peace and solitude, but overtime, the cold and darkness began to bother the Horse.</p>

                <p>The Horse then stopped chasing altogether. The Horse enjoyed the warmth, air and light of the Sun, and the peace and solitude of the Moon.</p>
