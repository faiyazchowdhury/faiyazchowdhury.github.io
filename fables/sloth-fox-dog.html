                <p>The Sloth, the Fox, and the Dog were friends. One day, they discovered a cave and they all entered. After some walking they arrived at the end and happened upon a tall tree with 4 berries on the ground next to it. They each ate one berry and it was absolutely delicious! Then a bird appeared from the tree and ate the remaining berry.</p>

                <p>They then noticed that the end of the cave had 2 more cave openings. Hoping to find more, the Fox and the Dog went into their separate openings hoping to find more berries, but the Sloth remained to eat the berries that would fall from the current tree.</p>

                <p>After more walking both the Fox and the Dog noticed more cave openings within the paths they chose. They both started making a map as they explored. In their exploration, they both found many trees. Some trees had many berries on the ground, some had a few. The Fox started counting the berries and marking the the number of berries found on the map. The Dog after having explored his side of the cave, marked the path to the cave that had the most berries.</p>

                <p>The Fox and the Dog then went to the tree with the most berries on their side and ate them. They returned to the first tree with the Sloth. They told the Sloth there are more berries, but the Sloth did not care.</p>

                <p>The next day, they returned to the cave. The Fox went to its side of the cave and went to the tree with the most berries. While eating the berries, the Fox counted them and noticed that there were less berries than what he had marked on the map and became upset. The Dog looked at his map and followed the path to the tree with the most berries and ate them and was very happy. They then returned to the first tree. The Fox told the Dog that he was frustrated because there were less berries this time. The Dog could not remember if he ate more berries than last time; he was just happy that he had a path to show him where to get the most berries.</p>
