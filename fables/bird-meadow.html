                <p>There was once Bird, flying through the sky. She loved flying, more than anything else. One day, while Bird was flying with her family, a storm had begun. The storm was too powerful and large to escape, and they were trying to evade the hard winds, the winds threw pebbles and branches at them. Bird and her family were hit and unable to fly, were flung to the ground.</p>

                <p>When the storm was finally over, the birds were hurt and could not fly. There was too much pain to go fly. The storm pushed them to a meadow, where many worms were dug up from the storm, and the Bird and her family could eat a lot of worms. It was very nice. They did not have to hunt for food. There was so much to eat where the storm had taken them.</p>

                <p>Once Bird had fully recovered, it started to fly again. It was soaring in the sky, but when she felt a strong wind, it got scared and did not evade the wind. The wind flung Bird to the ground near the meadow. Bird was once again hurt. Bird was again to injured to fly.</p>

                <p>Bird ate the worms and lived happily with family, and slept and enjoyed life. Once Bird was healed, she got ready to fly again, but as she saw a strong wind, she got scared. She decided to stay in the Meadow and stay with her family where it was nice.</p>

                <p>After a long time, Bird missed flying. She wanted to fly again, but her family said no. They said she would get hurt and that it was nice and safe there. But Bird was restless. One day, she told her family she must fly and flew to the sky. There was a strong wind. Bird was scared, but maneuvered the wind. Bird was happy. Bird would fly most of the day, and came back down to rest, eat and see her family. Seeing Bird, other brothers and sisters of Bird flew too, but some remained.</p>

                <p>One day, Bird wanted to go on a trip and fly far away. When Bird came back the next day, she saw only some of her brothers and sisters. They said that Cats came and tried to eat them. Her family had tried to fly away, but some were too heavy to fly, or were scared and were knocked back by the wind. The wind pushed them back to the ground. Bird and her remaining brothers and sisters mourned and then flew away.</p>
