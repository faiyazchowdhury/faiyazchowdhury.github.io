                <p>Once upon a time, a Parrot was born in the Forest. There he learnt to sing and chirp like the other parrots. It was very sweet and melodious. He loved singing with everyone.</p>

                <p>Still young, he then migrated around the world with his parents. When they travelled to the mountains, the wolves sang differently. They sang with howls. Their music was also different; very harmonic and sombre. The Parrot learnt how to howl their songs, and loved to sing with them.</p>

                <p>Then the Parrot migrated to the savannah, and met the lions. The lions sang by roaring, and their music was also very different; very slow but majestic. He also loved their music and learnt to sing like them.</p>

                <p>Then the Parrot migrated to the plains and met Eagles who loved to whistle. Their music was very conversational. The Parrot learnt their music as well. This same way, the Parrot then learnt the majestic hums from the camels in the dessert, and the entrancing trumpets of the elephants in the mangroves. All very different, but the parrot loved them all.</p>

                <p>When the Parrot grew up, he decided to migrate again and meet his old friends. He met the wolves and sang with their howls. Then the Parrot showed the other music he learnt, but the wolves did not like it. They wolves said the music was not proper, nor magical or enjoyable. It did not ring the same truth the music they were used to. But when the Parrot showed the songs to the cubs, they seemed to enjoy them more.</p>

                <p>When the Parrot migrated to other places to see his friends, he same thing happened. The Lions, Eagles, Camels, Elephants all said the same thing as the Wolves: they didn't like the music of the other places and they were not magical and did not ring true. But the children seemed to like the music more.</p>

                <p>To the Parrot, all music was magical, and each style from each animal and land rung it's own truth. The Parrot spent the rest of its life traveling and meeting new animals and their music.</p>
