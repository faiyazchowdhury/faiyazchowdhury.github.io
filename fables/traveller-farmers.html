            <div class="fable-text">
                <p>A Traveller happened upon three identical farms that were right next to each other, each filled with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. The Traveller inquired the owners and learned that they were brothers who had just inherited their lands from their prolific father. Aware that the farms were just big enough only to sustain a single person, the Traveller did not stay for long and continued with his travels.</p>

                <p>Years later the Traveller came across the same land. However, this time he saw a big farm, a farm that looked exactly the same as he had seen it years ago, and an enormous farm much bigger than both the other farms combined. Curious, he went to visit the big farm first.</p>

                <p>The Traveller noticed that the owner had a wife and a child now. The owner said that he had worked very hard to grow his farm. He had earned enough to sell the extra produce and provide for his wife and child, but the farm is so large that he has to work very hard just to maintain it. When the Traveller asked him why he worked so hard, the owner answered, "I want to be the most successful and the most happy I can be."</p>

                <p>The Traveller then went to the farm that had not changed. The Traveller saw that the owner still lived alone. The Traveller asked why he continued to live the same life, to which the owner replied, "I enjoy eating, and the farm provides enough food for me."</p>

                <p>Finally, the Traveller went to the largest farm. He saw that the owner had started a large family, and the children often helped in the farm, but the owner did a tremendous amount of work day to day. The owner said they had plenty of food and urged the Traveller to stay and eat with them. The Traveller asked the owner why he worked so hard, to which he replied, "I love farming."</p>
