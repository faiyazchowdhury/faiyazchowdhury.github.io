                <p>Once there were several Mountain Goats traveling together. Along they way, they saw that the path ahead was blocked, so they had to walk around it. On one side, there was a hill and on the other side was the valley, but both ended up in the same place.</p>

                <p>The Goats argued about which path was better and went separate ways. At first the Goats in the Hill struggled a lot climbing the hill, and the Valley Goats laughed and sneered at the Hill Goats. The Hill Goats said the Mountain Goats was stupid for choosing the harder way. Many of the Hill goats changed their mind and went to follow the Valley Goats. Their lives became much easier. But some of the Hill Goats remained.</p>

                <p>Half way though, the Hill reached it's peak, and the Valley reached it's trough. The remaining Hill Goats then found it much easier to go down the Hill. They became very strong from climbing the Hill. The Valley Goats now struggled to climb the Valley for the remaining path. They became too weak from walking such an easy path. Many of the Valley Goats wanted to give up, but they were stuck because now they had to walk up either way, even if they wanted to go back.</p>
