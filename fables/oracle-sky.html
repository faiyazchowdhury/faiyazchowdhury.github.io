            <div class="fable-text">
                <p>There was once an wise man who lived within the mountains. Often traveling to gain wisdom far and wide. When he returned, his fellow people would ask him what he had learnt and always asked for his advice and what they should do. Over the years, the he would grow old, and lost all his teeth and could no longer speak. He then lived alone in the mountain. They called him the Oracle.</p>

                <p>There was a long drought in the village, and people were suffering. They cared for the old Oracle, and asked a young boy to go up and bring food to him regularly. One day, there was a great rain, that revived the crops. The boy came running back from the mountain once the rain was gone, saying they saw something amazing in the sky in the mountain. Something he had not seen before. The villagers wanted to know what it was. Maybe it was a signal for what they should do to get rain.</p>

                <p>One villager walked to the mountain, and asked the Oracle what he saw, but the Oracle could not speak. "Was it red?" The man asked. The Oracle nodded. In their village, they knew red meant love. He went to the village and gave charity to the poor, and helped in the community center.</p>

                <p>The same day at a different time, another villager went to visit the Oracle. He asked the Oracle, "Was it green?" The Oracle nodded. The villager when back down, and worked very hard at the farm, because green meant hard work and nature.</p>

                <p>The next day different villager went up to the Oracle and asked, "Was it Yellow?" The Oracle nodded. The villager went down and began singing and dancing and praising life, because that was what yellow meant in their culture. He brought cheer to the people.</p>

                <p>The next day a different villager went up to the Oracle and asked, "Did it have blue?" The oracle nodded, but this time, the Oracle had a wide grin on his face as he was nodding. Satisfied, the villager turned around to go back to the village, but before he left, he thought for a second. He turned around and asked, "Did it have red?" The Oracle nodded. "Did it have green?" Again, the Oracle nodded. "Did it have yellow?" Again the Oracle nodded.</p>

                <p>"Did it have black?" The Oracle suddenly changed expression and shook his head. The villager let out a relieved sigh. The villager walked back down, happy knowing that they were all doing what they were supposed to. That they were all right.</p>
