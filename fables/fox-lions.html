                <p>The Fox became close friends with a pride of Lions. It began to hunt, eat and sleep with them as if they were all family. However, being smaller and weaker than the rest of the Lions, the Fox was not always able to catch the animals it hunted with the Lions.</p>

                <p>The Fox grew very hungry a few times and asked the Lions for meat, but the Lions were big and needed more food than the Fox. They refused to share and told the Fox that it didn't need much food. The Fox knew this was true, and dealt with its hunger.</p>

                <p>One day the Fox was extremely hungry and the Lions again refused the share their food. The Fox noticed one of the Lions had a lot of food, and then stole the food. The Fox enjoyed its meal, but then all the Lions roared and banished the Fox.</p>

                <p>Separated from the Pride of Lions, the Fox began hunting smaller animals like it was used to. It was happy because it wasn't hungry as often, but it did feel lonely. One day the Fox got lucky and got a lot of food from hunting. It saw that another Lion was unable to hunt any food for itself and the Fox came and shared its food with the Lion.</p>

                <p>The Lion was shocked that the Fox that shared the food was the same Fox that stole their food. The Lion gratefully ate the food that the Fox shared. The Fox gave more to the Lion than itself.</p>

                <p>The Lion was happy and roared to the rest of the Lions telling them how the Fox helped them. The Lions welcomed the Fox and made sure that the Fox was well-fed. When the Fox could not find food with the Lions, it hunted smaller animals alone. It grew hungry less often, but whenever the Fox was very hungry after its hunt, the Lions would share what they had to the Fox.</p>
