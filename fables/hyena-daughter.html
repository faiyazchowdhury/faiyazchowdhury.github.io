                <p>There once was a young Hyena that loved to listen to jokes and laugh. He would talk to all the other animals, and listen to all their jokes. He would cackle night and day. He really loved listening to everyone's jokes.</p>

                <p>But whenever the Hyena told a joke, no one really laughed. The Hyena was upset about this, so stopped trying to tell jokes, but still continued to listen and laugh at other's jokes.</p>

                <p>When the young Hyena grew up, he had a Daughter of his own. She also loved jokes and laughing. He wanted to make her laugh. So he practiced telling jokes. But all of the other animals did not like his jokes. This upset the Hyena, but he loved his daughter so much, he kept trying. Slowly and slowly, his jokes became funnier and funnier. And eventually, everyone laughed at his jokes. Then he could share his love for jokes and laugher to his Daughter, the one he loved so much.</p>
