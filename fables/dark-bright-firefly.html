                <p>The fireflies would always play at night. Sometimes, however, it became so dark that the fireflies sometimes unexpectedly crashed into each other. They would then get upset and get into an argument.</p>

                <p>Most of the fireflies disliked the Dark Firefly the most. The other fireflies could barely see where he was going so they would crash into him all the time. Over time, the Dark Firefly had come to understand that none of the fireflies liked to play with him, so he stopped playing altogether.</p>

                <p>However, all the fireflies loved to play with the new Firefly. She was a Bright Firefly. She was so bright, that even in the darkest of nights, all the fireflies could see her. None of the fireflies ever crashed with her, and they always wanted to play when she was playing.</p>

                <p>One day, the Bright Firefly noticed the Dark Firefly was not playing. The Bright Firefly stopped playing and asked the Dark Firefly to join them. The Dark Firefly declined and explained that they all hated him because they could not see him. Heartbroken, the Bright Firefly said they could play with only with each other, and she didn't mind if they crashed with each other.</p>

                <p>The Bright Firefly and the Dark Firefly then played tag every night. But no matter how much they played, they never crashed. The Dark Firefly, confused, asked the Bright Firefly, "How can you see me? How come we never crash?" The Bright Firefly answered, "You look just as bright as everyone else to me." Shocked the Dark Firefly looked at himself and saw that he could see himself. The light from the Bright Firefly was so bright, that it bounced off the Dark Firefly and made the Dark Firefly look bright.</p>

                <p>The Bright Firefly asked if the Dark Firefly could play with them, but they rejected. The Bright Firefly said she would not play with them if they did not let the Dark Firefly play as well. The fireflies then changed their mind and let both fireflies play. The Dark Firefly was very happy. None of the other fireflies crashed with him because the light of the Bright Firefly was so bright. The other fireflies began to start liking the Dark Firefly. As the Dark Firefly became happier and happier, he got brighter and brighter, and as he got brighter and brighter, the other fireflies liked playing with him more and more. Soon enough, he was as bright as all the other fireflies.</p>
