                <p>Once there were a Flock of Seagulls that would drop shells and rock at all the other animals that they did not like. This hurt a lot of animals so they complained to the Sea Lion. The Sea Lion made a rule that no animal can drop objects from the sky, and if they did the Sea Lion would eat the animal.</p>

                <p>All the other animals were very happy now, because most of the Seagulls stopped dropping rocks and shells from the sky.</p>

                <p>One day, there was a hungry Seagull that was struggling to find food. The Pigeon saw this and was able to find food and carried it and dropped it to the Seagull and the Seagull happily ate it. However, all the other animals told the Pigeon that he was bad for dropping something to the sky. The Sea Lion roared at the Pigeon and said the Pigeon will be eaten as punishment. The Pigeon pleaded that the Seagull was hungry and needed food. The Sea Lion forgave the Pigeon but said that the Pigeon should not break the rules anyway and disrespect the authority of the Sea Lion. The Sea Lion said that the rules brought peace to everyone.</p>

                <p>The Pigeon noticed that some animals still struggled to find food, so the Pigeon secretly dropped food to the animals when they were hungry. Sometimes, other animals noticed and told the Pigeon he was bad and did not care about the rules. But the Pigeon continued secretly dropping food, hoping that the Sea Lion would never find out.</p>
