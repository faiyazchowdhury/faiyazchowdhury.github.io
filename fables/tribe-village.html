                <p>Once there was an old traveling tribe that saw a big village that appeared empty. It was one unlike anything they saw. One of the tribesman was excited and said he wanted to go scout the village. After some hours, he came back and said, "There weren't many people. I only saw one person. I looked at him and he smiled at me. I think he was very nice. I think everyone there is probably nice, we should go meet them."</p>

                <p>The next day, one other tribesman said, "I think it is still too dangerous for all of us to go down. Let me go alone." and went to the big village. After some time, he came back and said, "It was very empty, but I saw someone, and he was very angry. I think he is bad. We shouldn't go. They are dangerous."</p>

                <p>The two tribesman started arguing that the other was wrong. Then a third tribesman said, "I am sad. You guys are fighting. You are my friends. Stop fighting. I will go." After sometime, he came back and said, "It was very empty, but I saw a very sad man. I looked at him and I could feel his pain."</p>

                <p>The next day a child from the tribe snuck into the village. After some time, he came back. His tribe was very worried. The child said, "It's okay, I didn't see many people. But I saw another kid. We waved at each other. I made a friend there!" But it was getting late so I ran back.</p>

                <p>The next day, the mother of the child, curious, went to the village. She came back saying, "I didn't see anyone accept a beautiful woman. But I was nervous and I ran away."</p>

                <p>Another tribesman, eager to see the beautiful woman, when to the village the next day, but came back looking disappointed. He said, "I didn't see anyone there except a tall, strong, but ugly looking man."</p>

                <p>The tribe was aware then there were many people in the village. A nice man, an angry man, a very sad man, a child, a beautiful woman, and a tall ugly man. They looked around and suddenly got shivers. They knew there was something strange about that place and decided they should stay away. But sometimes, the jolly man would sneak out to smile at the man he saw, and the child would go down to wave at the child he saw, and the man who saw the sad person would go down and just stand in front of the man he saw, to give him company, showing him that he understood how he felt. Sometime, the lustful man would go, always to come back disappointed unable to see the beautiful woman, and only see ugly men.</p>

                <p>The distrustful man always stayed away, knowing that they were all wrong. The village was bad, like the angry man he saw. The woman also stayed away, jealous of the woman she saw with all her beauty.</p>
