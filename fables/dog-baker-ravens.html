                <p>The Dog was loved by all, especially the Baker. The Baker one day baked a big loaf of brown bread for the Dog and the Dog took it home. Then a Reason of 10 Ravens appeared and asked if they could eat it. The Dog let them eat it and then went back to the Baker everyday, who would then bake the Dog more bread.</p>

                <p>Later a separate Reason of 20 Ravens appeared and asked if they could eat it with the 10 Ravens. The Dog let them. The Reason of 20 Ravens asked if the Dog could get sourdough bread instead. The Dog went to the Baker everyday and asked the Baker for sourdough bread. The Baker was more than happy to help the dog, and baked sourdough bread everyday.</p>

                <p>After some time, a Reason of 15 more Ravens appeared and asked the Dog if they could eat with the other Reasons. The Dog let them also join. This Reason of Ravens wanted brown bread, and the original 10 agreed. The Dog then asked the Baker to bake brown bread again, and the Baker was confused but did as the Dog pleased.</p>

                <p>Sometimes the Reason of Ravens that liked Sourdough were more, and sometimes the Reason of Ravens that liked brown bread were more, and the Dog asked the bread accordingly. But the Baker could not understand why the Dog kept changing its mind but thought it better not to ask.</p>
