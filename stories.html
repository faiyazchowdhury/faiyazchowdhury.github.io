        <div class="philosophy">
          <p>I love fables for many reasons. I like that they are timeless (so long as the animals don't go extinct). I like that are not preachy. They let the reader choose what they want to learn from them. I like that there is no good or evil in animals: it is just their nature, their valid survival philosophy. I see people the same way. None of us are evil, but our philosophies can resemble some of these animals. If we want to change, we just need to change our philosophies, everything else will follow. I like that fables resonate equally with the wise and old, and the bright and young. And in the end, it's a fun story, with emotion and a healthy acceptance of conflict and adventure.</p>
          <p>I often learn from other's interpretations of my own fables. Our interpretations say more about us than the stories themselves. When I see something that upsets me that stems from a systematic issue of human "strategy", I like to think of a story that communicates it in a way that even a child could understand.</p>
          <p>If you want to ask me about the meaning of life, I think it's about seeking a positive relationship with the world and the people in it. I like the way Ed Sheeran says it "Love and understanding positivity, but what do I know?". Really, I love talking about it. It's about the journey/conversation not the destination/conclusion.</p>
          <!-- <p>My biggest values are positivity, empathy, curiosity, imagination and presence.</p>
          <p>My biggest counter values are truth, honesty and perfection.</p>
          <p>I know that sounds ironic, but truth is an illusion no human should ever have the arrogance to believe that they have attained. That is why all the greatest physicist and musicians like Einstein and Neils Bohr and Ed Shreen remind us that they too are also just trying to figure it out.</p>
          <p>As for honesty, I am an honest person, but if someone else feels the need to lie, there is a justifiable reason for it. Only my compassion and curiosity can help me understand that reason.</p>
          <p>As for perfection, it is a simple consequence of expectation, which to me is the root of all unnecessary suffering. I disagree that you need a goal to progress.</p> -->
