                <div class="poem-text">
                    <p>Water and Stone start at the mountain top<br>
                    One formed from wet cloud in sky,<br>
                    The other, from hot earth as rock.</p>

                    <p>Water, with full force and might,<br>
                    Flows anywhere, but with no end in sight.<br>
                    Stone with all form and structure,<br>
                    Forms the course, but no way to get there</p>

                    <p>Water flows down the track, crashing with Stone,<br>
                    Havoc on impact, a tempest on land.<br>
                    But through time both are shown,<br>
                    A peaceful soft white sand.</p>

                    <p>The crashes continue down the mountain track,<br>
                    Water disturbs Stone, while Stone blocks the path.</p>

                    <p>As the years and years pass, water pulls Stone, while Stone shows the way,<br>
                    What started as conflict had past,<br>
                    Becoming of love, help and play</p>

                    <p>At last, they reach the coast and basin,<br>
                    A great deal away from fight and sin.<br>
                    Though they think they arrived at paradise<br>
                    They actually made it through their own sacrifice.</p>

                    <p>The sand at bottom, was born from Water and Stone at top,<br>
                    Where the Water and Stone had learnt together, to let the fight stop.<br>
                    Once they reach the bottom of terrain,<br>
                    The cycle resets, to being their journey again.</p>
