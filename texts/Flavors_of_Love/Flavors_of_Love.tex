% The Songs

\chapter{Made With Love}

\begin{verse}
When I first played this song,\\
You said it was wrong,\\
You said it ought to be sadder,\\
I've spent all this while\\
In making you smile,\\
Oh how can I make it better?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
My song,\\
You said,\\
It's not good enough\\
I know\\
I know,\\
But it's made with love
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When I showed you the songs I've written before,\\
You said you heart filled with envy,\\
Didn't write one for you, but did for the whore,\\
I could see in your heart was a frenzy
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I said,\\
Your song,\\
Wasn't good enough\\
You said,\\
You know,\\
But it's made with love
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
It's hard to write a sad song when I think of you,\\
When I'm with you I just so happy,\\
That doesn't mean that my love is not true,\\
And I'm sorry it just too sappy,
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
It's been a year since you've been in my arms,\\
And I've had time to ponder,\\
I'll re-sing this song and undo the harm,\\
How does it feel I wonder,
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
My life,\\
Is still\\
Not good enough\\
But still\\
You know,\\
It's made with love
\end{verse}


\chapter{Euphoria}

\begin{verse}
You dance here before me\\
I feel a touch, romance\\
I try my best to assume me\\
That I could have a chance
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
A chance to feel much wonder\\
As I look into your eyes\\
A hope that we'll grow fonder\\
As our time flies
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Oh I feel sweet euphoria,\\
How do you feel for me?\\
Nothing to fear I assure ya\\
If I swept you off you feet
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Oh life a wandering journey\\
Full of joy and mystery\\
Oh you could spend it with me\\
A world of us to see.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
But now you're so far away,\\
And I'm worried that you'd have changed.\\
And you say you don't want to see me, and I don't know what to say.\\
And I'm sitting down here waiting, I almost feel deranged\\
But then I see you again, and I feel hope once again.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Now you dance here right before me, and I ask for one last chance\\
I hold your hand gently, would you like to dance?
\end{verse}


\chapter{Rock my World}

\begin{verse}
Passed the days, since you've been away,\\
Was empty inside.\\
Went on some dates, but I didn't stay.\\
Need you by my side.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Tried to go a week, without you,\\
No FaceTime or text,\\
Swear I'm not weak, my dear it's true\\
Can't wait to meet next.
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Pre-Chorus]}\\
\begin{verse}
Don't you feel the same.\\
A heaven in your heart\\
Would you feel a pain,\\
If we fell a apart.
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Chorus]}\\
\begin{verse}
Come here girl, and rock my world.\\
before it too late.\\
Hold my hands tight, I'll give you a swirl.\\
Let's go on a date.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Sometimes I'm scared, of moving on.\\
Won't see you again,\\
Doesn't it bother you, that we won't talk,\\
For hours on end,
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
(They keep me alive, the light in your eyes.\\
So solid and true,\\
I pray to see it again, the day mine dies.\\
I swear I love you.)
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Pre-Chorus]}\\
\begin{verse}
Something as sweet, as hearing your voice\\
Wakes up my soul,\\
I pray I'll see the lights in your eyes\\
When mine are no more,
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Solo]/[Chorus]}

\begin{verse}
Promise me that we're still friends,\\
Through pleasure and pain\\
If you change, your mind in the end\\
I'll love you again
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Chorus]/[End]}


\chapter{Rosewood Guitars}

\begin{verse}
She walked in the room.\\
With a smell of perfume.\\
I was mesmerized when I looked in-\\
To her eyes.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Eyes wide like the skies,\\
They shine like the stars,\\
With a shade of hazel that resemble,\\
Rosewood guitars.
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Pre-Chorus]}\\
\begin{verse}
I keep dreaming about you,\\
I'm wondering, if dreams come true.\\
I'm lost alone without you\\
So come back, and let's see this through
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Chorus]}\\
\begin{verse}
I'll be the bass string, and you'll be the A String,\\
Maybe when we're older, have four strings of our own.\\
I'll rock and you'll sing, won't you put on the ring\\
Won't you be a part of my family and home
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I'm feeling so blue,\\
When I'm without you,\\
You know I love my self the most\\
.... When I love you
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I know it's not true,\\
That you love me too.\\
But don't think think it's special, how we're gentle\\
With each other's hearts
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Pre-chorus]}

\textbf{[Chorus]}

\begin{verse}
When I hear her voice\\
My feelings rejoice\\
And when I fell her ear, my lungs\\
Are grasping for air.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When I see her face,\\
I'm in a different place.\\
A place I'm alway happy, I know it's sappy.\\
Don't you feel the same?
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Pre-chorus]}

\begin{verse}
She walked in the room.\\
With a smell of perfume.\\
I was mesmerized when I looked in-\\
To her eyes.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Eyes wide like the skies,\\
They shine like the stars,\\
With a shade of hazel that resemble,\\
Rosewood guitars.
\end{verse}


\chapter{Excuse Me Miss}

\begin{verse}
Never thought before such beauty could exist,\\
You're dancing on the floor, what a wonder to be blissed,\\
My brain says to ignore but I cannot resist,\\
Alas, my heart is sore, my stomach in a twist,
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
To ask you to a dance, I have to take your hand\\
But I'm stuck in a trance, I cannot even stand\\
You look at me and I just try to fake a smile\\
The truth, my heart it wails, just yearning for a while.
\end{verse}

\textbf{(Chorus)}\\
\begin{verse}
Excuse me miss?\\
Would you like to dance?\\
If you feel romance?\\
May I steal kiss?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I know that you will find I'm a little bit insane,\\
I wonder if my mind will ever be the same,\\
You may think I've I lost all sensibility\\
But my madness is my one stability
\end{verse}

\textbf{(Chorus)}\\
\begin{verse}
Excuse me miss?\\
Would you like to dance?\\
And if you feel romance?\\
May I steal kiss?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
My heart, it burns, an ember set aflame\\
Yet somehow it churns a cold December rain\\
Wouldst thou like to dance lady Katerina dear\\
 \foreignlanguage{russian}{Потанцуем, моя балерина и мир}
\end{verse}


\chapter{That's What I Call}

\textit{D, Bm, G, A}\\
\begin{verse}
I was running alone,\\
Then you showed me your home,\\
And after I stayed for a while,\\
My frown turned into a smile.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
You are good and kind,\\
A beautiful soul and mind,\\
Someone I didn't think to find,\\
Maybe our fates were intertwined
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
That's what I call a friend,\\
Someone who makes the pain all end,\\
Something that never ever ends,\\
Just when I need a friend.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I'm trying to fill that void,\\
Familiar pain that I avoid,\\
And I have lonely days,\\
But you showed me your ways,
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
That's what I call a home,\\
Somewhere the heart and mind has grown,\\
Something that ends the pointless roam,\\
Just when I need a home
\end{verse}

\textit{Bm, G, D, A}\\
\begin{verse}
And I wonder if anything this nice could last forever, last forever,\\
But if the love inside of all our hearts can bring us all, all together, it doesn't matter
\end{verse}

\textit{D, Bm, G, A}\\
\begin{verse}
That's what I call love,\\
Something that's always more than enough,\\
Something that helps when times are tough,\\
Just when I need love.
\end{verse}


\chapter{Sparky}

\textit{A, Gm, D, A,E}\\
\begin{verse}
Improvise cute lyrics about Sparky

Sparky \\
Sparky \\
Sparky \\
Sparky \\
\end{verse}

\chapter{Sweetest Reminder}

\begin{verse}
When I am with you I want to dance, with you\\
And As I see you I'm in a trance, with you\\
And when I think of you I smell that Chance, perfume\\
But you are moving away to France
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When I see you I'm hypnotized, by your, brown eyes\\
That have the power to see through my white lies,\\
When I'm feeling lost I sing the blues, it's true\\
Girl you know I'm lonely without you
\end{verse}

\textbf{[Chorus]}\\
\begin{verse}
Cause it's not so easy, with all that you've got,\\
And when you're near me, can't get enough\\
So when you see me, I crack a smile, And we pass the while,\\
And doesn't it please you, whenever I tease you, cause I just can't get enough, SO when you're near, oh won't you please here me sing this song.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Remember when we stole burgers, from North Ave\\
Remember when we shared Kinders, in French class\\
You are the sweetest reminder,\\
Of a time our eyes were filled with wonder
\end{verse}

\textbf{Chorus}

\begin{verse}
Kiedy jestem z toba, Isia,\\
Chce mowic po polska, Misa\\
Chce tancic z toba\\
Moja Przyiacioka Ludwisia
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When I am with you I want to dance, with you\\
When I see you I'm in a Trance\\
You know I really miss that Chance perfume\\
Let's dance and give romance one chance
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I often to think of, of you\\
I fear that I may fall in love, with you\\
I never thought it would be this though\\
Our time together is not enough
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I miss when we would chat in Skype,l\\
Pusheen emojis when we'd type, online\\
No need no Tinder don't want to swipe\\
Clause I Really thought you were just my type.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Please tell me I will see your Face again sometime\\
I mean in person not in Face, FaceTime,\\
Cause I'll miss that smile and morning grace, that shine,\\
In the moment everything seemed fine.
\end{verse}
